# Security

## Credentials

Atlas never stores, reads, or manages provider credentials. Authentication is delegated
entirely to each provider's own CLI (`claude`, `codex`, `gemini`, `agy`, `hermes`) — Atlas only spawns
that binary and streams its stdout/stderr (see [providers.md](providers.md)). Before any of
that stdout/stderr is persisted, `redactRuntimeText()`
(`src/infrastructure/observability/runtime-logger.ts`) strips known credential shapes
(vendor API key prefixes, bearer tokens, JWTs, PEM keys, connection strings, webhook URLs)
plus a high-entropy-token fallback for unrecognized secrets. This is pattern- and
entropy-based, best-effort redaction, not a filesystem-level or cryptographic guarantee — a
credential shaped like ordinary low-entropy text could still slip through.

## Public engine / private workspace boundary

This repository contains no user data. All user and technical state lives in a private
workspace outside of `engine/` (see [workspace.md](workspace.md)), which:

- Is not part of this repository's git history.
- Is git-ignored by this repository's `.gitignore` as a safety net (`personal/*`,
  `projects/*`, and `system/*`) even if a workspace is ever accidentally nested inside a clone.
- Is created by `atlas setup` with `config` restricted to `0700` permissions.

## Filesystem access

Profiles declare `allowedPaths`, and `buildContext` only reads a `contextSources` entry if
it resolves inside one of those paths (see [context.md](context.md)). The schema also
carries `allowedCommands` and `writePolicy` per profile (see [profiles.md](profiles.md));
the run boundary rejects an unauthorized provider command and an empty `allowed-paths`
policy. Direct interception keeps provider-owned execution behavior. Atlas does not currently
provide an enforcing filesystem sandbox, so writable profiles fail closed. Atlas does not copy
or invent credentials; authentication remains owned by each provider CLI.

## Data validation

Before publication, run `pnpm check:privacy`. This read-only release-gate scan checks tracked
and publishable untracked source, documentation, and templates for credential patterns, real
private paths, and personal data. It reports finding types and file paths without secret values
and fails closed; Git-ignored machine-local files, license text, dependencies, and build output
are intentionally ignored.

Profiles, sessions, and context manifests are all validated against Zod schemas on read and
write (`profile-validator.ts`, `session-validator.ts`, `context-validator.ts`), so malformed
state fails fast rather than propagating silently.

## Session status integrity

Session status transitions are enforced by `assertValidStatusTransition`
(`src/domain/sessions/session.ts`): a session can only move along the documented
lifecycle (see [sessions.md](sessions.md#status-lifecycle)); `cancelled` is terminal.

## Installation and bypass boundaries

`atlas install` uses only cataloged package-manager recipes and requires `--yes`. Unknown
clients and arbitrary URLs are rejected. `atlas update` repeats the approved recipe; `atlas
remove` removes only Atlas registration, wrappers, and receipts. Provider binaries, user data,
and provider-owned credentials remain outside Atlas ownership.

Native desktop clients, absolute-path launches, unconfigured shells, and operating-system
processes outside the managed shim remain explicit bypass boundaries. Atlas reports these when
detectable; it does not claim universal interception.

Gateway credentials support an identity and optional profile scope using the environment-only
format `id@profile-a|profile-b=token`; an unscoped `token` remains the default identity. Each
gateway request includes an approval fingerprint over its exact profile and prompt, and the
resulting session records the gateway identity. MCP writes and promotions use the same
action-bound approval model. These bindings constrain the request; they do not replace provider
authentication.
