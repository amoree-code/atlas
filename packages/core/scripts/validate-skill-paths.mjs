// Home-relative paths a skill names must exist: in every .md under a skill (SKILL.md and
// references/), as a whole backticked path, a backticked command, or a command line. Not
// covered: repo-relative paths, brace/placeholder templates, symlinked skill directories.
//
// T-244: five of the running skills pointed at ~/atlas/engine/scripts/ and
// ~/.ai-os/user/... for weeks after the T-224 rename moved those trees. Nothing caught it,
// because validate-skills.mjs only checks frontmatter against the catalog and only sees
// the nine packaged skills — not the hub the clients actually read.
//
// Two things keep this from being noise, which is the only way a check survives:
//
//   - Paths carrying a placeholder are skipped. They describe a shape, not a file.
//   - The *parent directory* is what must exist, not the leaf. Skills legitimately name
//     files they create on first use (`~/.claude/loop.md`); none of them legitimately
//     name a file inside a tree that is not there. That is what rot looks like, and it is
//     what `~/atlas/engine/scripts/` and `~/.ai-os/user/...` both were.
